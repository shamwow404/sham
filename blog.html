      <h3>Building my first github page!!</h3>
      <p class="post-date">Posted: 12/04/25</p>
      <p>After working with someone on building a website for an NFT project, I realised building a personal webpage isn't so hard LOL. I guess the web development subject I did at university really discouraged me with their overuse of frameworks making everything super confusing for me. Vanilla JS is kinda based tho just saying! I have so many plans for this page, I want it to be a showcase for everthing I work on, more than just a github but something super cute and beautiful..</p>
      <p><em>I did some research a few years ago on bias in data and methods of data collection that could be creating barriers for people who would otherwise be giving diverse types of data.. Why don't women actively use certain types of websites? Uhhhh probably beause they're UGLY!!!! <br>
      So yeah it's my goal to create a page that is pleasing to the female gaze :3 <br><br>
      Apart from that, my short term plan is to get the robot arm simulator working. Eventually you will be able to build a robot arm, to the desired degree of freedom (Dof) as well as selecting joint types and link lengths. You will be able to preview the robot arm before you "deploy" which will then allow you to simulate the arm and attempt to move some simulated blocks.<br>
      This is something I am working on at university in my current study of kinematics!<br>
      I am pretty excited to have something working so I can start sharing the link to this page &hearts; </em></p>
