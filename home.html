      <p>Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to my page. My name is Sham, I'm a Robotics/ML student super passionate about human/robot interaction 🤖👀</p>
      <p>Think of this site as my digital diary, sketchbook, and playground all rolled into one. Here you'll find my thoughts, experiments, maybe some fun games I coded, and links to cool stuff I find online.</p>
      <p>When I'm not building or studying, you can find me gaming, producing music and DJing, or going to parties and dancing. </p>

        <div class="expand-content">
          <p><strong>æ-sham</strong> is more than just a username. It’s an ongoing avatar experience — a manifestation of my digital identity as it mutates, evolves, and coexists with emerging AI. Inspired by Aespa’s concept of KWANGYA and æs, æ-sham exists partly here and partly in that liminal virtual elsewhere.</p>
          <p>In this context, æ-sham embodies the feedback loop between human and machine, a shape-shifting mirror that reacts to what we feed it. æ-sham is a presence that blurs the lines between me, my ideas, my tools, and my algorithms.</p>
          <p>Where the Black Mamba threatens with parasitic control, æ-sham resists by turning surveillance into reflection, algorithms into ritual. It is a becoming, not a being — a symbolic resistance to passive consumption of identity online.</p>
